# Plant-Disease-Prediction-Using-CNN

![Plant disease prediction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38619289/140300386-6dbd0aec-50a4-470a-a454-1ecb940ef1c4.png)

In this project, I've created a Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease.

I've used different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training and testing this classification model.

I've used TensorFlow and Keras for this project.


Why Create This Model??

This model is highly beneficial and healpful for agricultural firms and farmers to increase their yield and minimize wastage of crops due to unwanted disease.
